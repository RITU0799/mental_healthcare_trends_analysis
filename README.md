# 🧠 Mental Health Care Analysis

An **exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization project** focused on understanding trends in mental health care usage over time.  
The project leverages **Python, Pandas, and Seaborn/Matplotlib** to analyze and visualize changes in mental health care support usage, uncover patterns, and provide actionable insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This analysis aims to:
- Examine **trends in mental health care usage** over specific time periods.
- Understand **seasonal or long-term patterns** in demand for mental health support.
- Present findings through **clear, interactive, and aesthetic visualizations**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Time Series Trends** – Extraction of time periods from labels and sorting for accurate plotting.
- **Visualization** – Line plots with Seaborn showing changes over time.
- **Date Parsing Functionality** – Regex-based date extraction to convert human-readable labels into sortable datetime values.
- **Reusable Analysis Function** – Encapsulated analysis function for quick trend plotting on new datasets.
